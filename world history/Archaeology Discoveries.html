                For thousands of years, ancient civilizations built monuments, buried their dead with treasures, and left behind clues about how they lived. Most of this was lost, buried, or destroyed. But when archaeologists find these sites intact, they rewrite what we know about human history.
                
                <div class="stat-highlight" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                    <strong style="color: #daa520;">Key Pattern:</strong> The best discoveries happen when sites are found UNDISTURBED - meaning grave robbers, treasure hunters, or modern construction didn't get there first. That's why intact tombs are so valuable: they're time capsules.

It took 4 YEARS to clear the stairs. At the bottom: a chamber containing Pakal's sarcophagus, covered by a 5-ton carved lid, with Pakal's skeleton wearing a jade burial mask.

Nobody knows yet - no way to access it without damaging the pyramid.

                    <ul style="margin: 15px 0 0 30px; color: #d1d5db;">
                        <li>Social hierarchy (some people more important than others)</li>
                        <li>Spiritual beliefs requiring specialists (shamans/healers)</li>
                        <li>Complex burial rituals</li>
                        <li>Ability to support individuals who couldn't hunt/gather (she had physical disabilities but clearly held high status)</li>

                    "The diversity and number of grave goods, the special treatment of the body, and the animal remains suggest this was no ordinary burial. This woman likely served as a ritual specialist - a mediator between the human and spiritual worlds."

            <h2 class="section-title">What These Discoveries Teach Us</h2>

            <div style="color: #d1d5db; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9;">
                <h3 style="color: #daa520; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">1. Humans Have Always Been Creative and Complex</h3>
                <p>Whether it's 12,000 years ago (Natufian shaman) or 5,000 years ago (Egyptian pyramids), humans were building, creating art, establishing social hierarchies, and practicing elaborate rituals. The "primitive caveman" stereotype is wrong.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #daa520; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">2. Technology Changes What We Can Find</h3>
                <p>LiDAR scans found entire Maya cities in 2022 that archaeologists had walked past for decades. Cosmic-ray imaging found hidden chambers in the Great Pyramid in 2017. New technology = new discoveries in places we thought we knew.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #daa520; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">3. Most Sites Were Looted Long Ago</h3>
                <p>That's why intact tombs (Tutankhamun, Pakal, SipÃ¡n) are so valuable - they're the exception, not the rule. Grave robbers have been stealing from tombs for thousands of years. When we find one that survived, it's a miracle.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #daa520; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">4. Independent Development Across Continents</h3>
                <p>Pyramids in Egypt and pyramids in Peru. Urban planning in Mesopotamia and urban planning at Caral. Complex societies developed independently on different continents, suggesting these patterns are part of how humans organize when populations grow.</p>

                <div class="stat-highlight" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Archaeology keeps rewriting what we know. The more we dig (literally and technologically), the more we realize ancient humans were sophisticated, creative, and capable of incredible achievements - often much earlier than we thought possible.
