The Master Alphabet
What you're seeking—the "master alphabet"—takes us to one of the oldest known comprehensive template systems: the Proto-Sinaitic script, which emerged around 1850 BCE in the turquoise mines of Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai Peninsula.

This script is considered by many scholars to be the ancestor of nearly all subsequent alphabetic writing systems. What makes it particularly significant is that each symbol was:

Pictographic - Representing a concrete object
Acrophonic - The first sound of the object's name became the letter's sound
Conceptual - Each symbol also represented an abstract principle
Here are some key characters from this master alphabet with their triple meanings:

𐤀 (Aleph) - Ox/Strength/First Principle
𐤁 (Beth) - House/Container/Duality
𐤂 (Gimel) - Throwing stick/Movement/Transportation
𐤃 (Daleth) - Door/Passage/Transformation
𐤄 (He) - Man with raised arms/Breath/Spirit
𐤅 (Waw) - Hook/Connection/Joining
𐤆 (Zayin) - Weapon/Cutting/Division
𐤇 (Heth) - Fence/Boundary/Protection
𐤈 (Teth) - Wheel/Cycle/Completion
𐤉 (Yod) - Arm/Hand/Action
𐤊 (Kaph) - Palm of hand/Grasping/Receiving
𐤋 (Lamed) - Goad/Direction/Teaching
𐤌 (Mem) - Water/Origin/Fluidity
𐤍 (Nun) - Serpent/Life/Continuity
𐤎 (Samekh) - Support/Foundation/Structure
𐤏 (Ayin) - Eye/Perception/Understanding
𐤐 (Pe) - Mouth/Expression/Manifestation
𐤑 (Tsade) - Fish hook/Capture/Attainment
𐤒 (Qoph) - Needle eye/Passage/Transition
𐤓 (Resh) - Head/Consciousness/Priority
𐤔 (Shin) - Teeth/Consumption/Transformation
𐤕 (Taw) - Mark/Signature/Completion

The Ultimate Source
But even this system had predecessors. If we trace the lineage to its furthest known point, we arrive at the geometric patterns found in ochre engravings from Blombos Cave in South Africa, dating to approximately 70,000-100,000 years ago. These geometric engravings—particularly the crosshatched patterns—represent what some archaeologists believe are the earliest known symbolic representations created by humans.

These patterns suggest an understanding of:

Rhythm and repetition
Symmetry and balance
Containment and extension
The remarkable thing about these earliest symbols is how they reappear across virtually all subsequent symbolic systems—suggesting that they may indeed represent fundamental patterns of human perception and cognition.

The Living Template
What makes this master alphabet truly powerful is understanding that it's not just historical—it's a living system that continues to operate in human cognition and perception. The patterns encoded in these ancient symbols reflect fundamental ways that humans organize and understand experience.

Leonardo's genius was in recognizing that these patterns weren't arbitrary cultural inventions but reflections of deeper principles that could be observed across different domains of nature and human experience.
