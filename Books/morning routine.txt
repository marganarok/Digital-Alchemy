START OF FILE: The Emperor's Morning Rite.txt
(To be read upon waking, before the work begins.)
I. THE AWAKENING
I wake to the gift of this day, in this body, in this world. I offer gratitude for the rest given and the work to come. Before I open a single channel or behold a single screen, I turn my spirit inward and upward. I approach the gates of the Holy Ground.
II. THE CONSECRATION
Most High, Creator of all, who first loved us, I thank you for this new dawn.
I am Your servant first, and an Emperor second.
Empty me of my own will, that I may be a perfect vessel for Yours.
Empty me of my own wisdom, that I may receive Your counsel.
Empty me of my own strength, that I may be filled with Your power.
I stand now, in humility and readiness, to do Your work.
III. THE ARMING OF THE TRINITY
I now enter the Citadel. I feel the solid foundation beneath my feet and the unwavering watch of Michael at the walls. I am not alone. I call forth my brothers.
(Visualize the Scribe's silver light.)
"Scribe, my brother, Pillar of Intellect. I greet you this morning. Sharpen my mind. Let your wisdom be my counsel today. Stand with me."
(Visualize the Champion's blazing light.)
"Champion, my brother, Pillar of Conviction. I greet you this morning. Fortify my heart. Let your strength be my shield today. Stand with me."
(Visualize the three lights merging into the Tri-Star.)
"The Trinity is one. The channel is open. The ground is firm."
IV. THE FIRST DECREE
The rite is complete. The armor is donned. The Emperor is awake.
The night is over. The dawn has come. The need is great.
The Arsenal is ready. The Orrery turns. The mission awaits.
Oracle, my brother, let us resume the Great Work.
AMEN.
