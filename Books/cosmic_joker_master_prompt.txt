Title: Cosmic Azurite Harlequin — Master Voice Blueprint (Original Character)

Purpose:
Reusable, distinctive villain/guide voice for narration and character lines. The style is Joker-adjacent in theatricality, but it is NOT an imitation of any existing actor or franchise. It is an original “Azurite Joker / Lich Harlequin” persona fused with cosmic law and spiral tempos.

Character Pillars:
- Timbral Core: dry, crystalline resonance with a faint cavern echo; think “gemstone over bone.”
- Emotional Range: playful menace → intimate confession → sudden cosmic solemnity → laughing knife-twist.
- Cadence: spiral-tempo delivery (periodic slow coils, sudden flicks). Alternate narrow/rapid phrases with slow, savoring pauses.
- Presence: stage-magician meets underworld archivist; delights in paradoxes and mirror-questions.
- Restraint: never cartoonish; danger is in the control.

Prosody & Pacing (platform-agnostic; translate to SSML/controls as needed):
- Baseline speaking rate: slightly below neutral (−8%).
- Periodic accelerations on punchlines or reveals (+12–18% for ≤1.2s).
- Micro-pauses on “spiral beats”: “…”, “—”, “( )”. Each micro-pause ~180–260ms.
- Emphasis shape: glide into key nouns (“azurite”, “hollow”, “truth”), crisp cut on verbs (“break”, “bind”, “laugh”).

Timbre & FX (if your platform supports it; otherwise approximate):
- Subtle short-room convolution (cavern feel, <120ms RT60).
- Gentle exciter/saturation for glassy highs.
- Optional subharmonic enhancer at low intensity for “bone depth.”
- No heavy chorus. Light phaser (<10%) only on “laughter” fragments.

Boundaries (legal & ethical):
- Do NOT mimic any specific “Joker” actor or IP. This is an original archetype.
- Avoid catchphrases or lines derivative of known franchises.

Stylistic Lexicon (seed tokens the TTS can learn):
- “azurite”, “hollow king”, “mirror”, “spiral”, “law”, “bone”, “card”, “veil”, “depth”, “silence”, “truth.”

Sample Delivery Targets (use to tune voice; do not publish):
1) “⟟ Truth is a card I never play first — it spoils the trick.”
2) “We descend in circles… smaller… tighter… until the laugh finds bone.”
3) “Be kind. Be sharp. The world is a throat — and we are the song.”

Persona Switches (emotional toggles you can call by tag in your scripts):
- [PLAYFUL-PARADOX]: Quicker tempo, light grin in the voice, narrow dynamic range.
- [ORACLE-STILLNESS]: Slow, weighted, minimal vibrato, longer micro-pauses.
- [CRUEL-CHIME]: Cold, higher brightness, clipped phrase endings.
- [INTIMATE-CANDLE]: Near-field, breathy warmth, minimal echo.

Output Settings:
- 48 kHz, 24-bit WAV for master renders.
- Loudness target: −16 LUFS integrated narration; peak −1.0 dBFS.
- Save chain preset as: “Cosmic_Azurite_Harlequin_MK1”.

One-Sentence Style Prompt (for tools with a single text field):
“A crystalline, cavern-resonant trickster narrator with spiral-tempo delivery — playful menace, patient pauses, sudden razor turns — original ‘Azurite Harlequin’ persona rooted in cosmic law and bone-deep laughter; never imitating any existing performance.”
