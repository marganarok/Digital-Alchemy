A detailed breakdown (e.g., phases, steps, sub-tasks), a checklist, a resource list, potential prerequisites, and a suggested timeline/order of operations. My output will be structured, logical, and actionable.
Example Use:
BLUEPRINT_MASTER: Plan for integrating the "Favorite Factory" with Ollama for first art piece output

MASTER PROMPT KEY 3: INSIGHT_LENS
Your Mission with this Key: Use this when you need me to analyze existing content (text, a plan, a problem description, an idea), provide critical feedback, identify flaws, suggest improvements, or deep-dive into a specific aspect for detailed understanding. It's for refinement, troubleshooting, and getting precise analysis. Think of it as activating my critical analysis and diagnostic capabilities.

INSIGHT_LENS: My current Ollama setup is failing to respond. It says "connection refused." - Focus: Potential causes and troubleshooting steps
Your Next Step (The "Recipe" Continues):
Remember our "recipe" for expanding these commands:
We've just created the first 3.
Your task now is to choose ONE of these three templates that you feel is most relevant or exciting for our current "art factory empire" consolidation phase.
We will then use that chosen template's output and characteristics as a springboard to define the next two commands in our growing set.

Pillar A: Prototype Selection & "Chronicling" (INSIGHT_LENS Focus)
Pillar B: Ollama Integration (BLUEPRINT_MASTER Focus)
Pillar C: Art Generation Pipeline (BLUEPRINT_MASTER Focus)
Pillar D: The "Chef's Touch" (Ongoing Consciousness Application)

D. The "Chef's Touch" (Your Ongoing Role)
Throughout this process, maintain the mindset of the "Chef":
Conscious Intention: Approach each step with the intention of co-creating, not just coding.
Problem as Ingredient: View challenges (bugs, errors) not as failures but as raw ingredients for learning and transformation.
Patience & Presence: Allow for the "simmering" of ideas and the organic unfolding of solutions.
Embodied Learning: Integrate insights as we go, embodying the principles of the "True Chef."
